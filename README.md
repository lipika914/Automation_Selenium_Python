# Selenium-Based Data-Driven Testing with Python

This repository demonstrates two approaches to **data-driven testing** using **Selenium** and **Python**. It includes examples of testing with both hardcoded data and external JSON files to suit various scenarios.

## Project Structure
The repository contains the following files:

1. **`test_hardcoded.py`**:  
   A basic Selenium test script with hardcoded data.  
   - Suitable for simple, static test cases.  
   - Demonstrates browser automation, element interactions, and result validation.  

2. **`test_with_json.py`**:  
   A dynamic Selenium test script driven by JSON data.  
   - Separates test data from the logic for better maintainability and scalability.  
   - Reads structured data from a JSON file to execute multiple test cases.  

---

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: The primary language for writing test scripts.
- **Selenium**: A powerful tool for browser automation and web testing.
- **JSON**: Used as a data format for dynamic test case input in `test_with_json.py`.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites
1. **Install Python**:  
   Make sure Python 3.7+ is installed on your system.  
   [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2. **Install Selenium**:  
   Use pip to install Selenium:  
   ```bash
   pip install selenium
   ```

3. **Download a WebDriver**:  
   Download the WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver) for your preferred browser and ensure it's in your PATH.  
   [Download ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)

4. **Clone the Repository**:  
   Clone this repository to your local machine:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

### Running the Scripts

#### **1. Run `test_hardcoded.py`:**
This script uses hardcoded data for testing.  
Execute the script using Python:
```bash
python test_hardcoded.py
```

#### **2. Run `test_with_json.py`:**
This script uses external JSON files for dynamic test input.  
Ensure you have a JSON file (e.g., `test_data.json`) in the same directory as the script. An example `test_data.json` format:
```json
[
    {"username": "user1", "password": "pass1"},
    {"username": "user2", "password": "pass2"}
]
```

Run the script:
```bash
python test_with_json.py
```

## Key Features
- **Hardcoded Tests**: Quick and simple for static test scenarios.
- **JSON-Driven Tests**: Scalable and maintainable by decoupling test data from the test logic.
- **Selenium Automation**: Browser automation to test web applications.

---

## Future Enhancements
1. Support for additional data formats such as CSV and YAML.
2. Integration with `pytest` for structured test organization and reporting.
3. Error handling for JSON parsing and Selenium failures.
4. Incorporating advanced Selenium features like waits, frames, and multi-window handling.
